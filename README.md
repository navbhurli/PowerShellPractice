# This is a practice program/script that will be compiled to an exe

This is a program that helps SCCM team to clean up a collection by deleting/removing all the members from it.

Upon launch as admin, there would be a pop-up asking for collection name.

On entering collection name and clicking ok, if the collection exists or if the collection name is spelled correct, then there would be a confirmation pop-up.

On confirming (by clicking "yes"), the program/script will delete/remove all the members from the group.

If everything is successful, there will be a confirmational information pop-up.

Many checks and conditions are added to handle multiple possible errors.
